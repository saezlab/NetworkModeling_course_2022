## Introduction

The goal of this tutorial is to introduce the CellNOpt framework ([Terfve et al.
2012](https://bmcsystbiol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1752-0509-6-133))
and give some basics in network motifs.

## CellNOptR

CellNOptR is a R implementation of the CellNOpt framework and can be used to

-   create logic-based models of signaling networks using different formalisms
    (Boolean, Fuzzy, or differential equations)
-   combine prior knowledge and perturbation experiments
-   build an executable model that can be executed (simulated) and used to make
    predictions for testable hypotheses.

These specific, contextualised models can be used, for example, to understand
the different signaling patterns among cell-lines or patients or to predict drug
response.

CNORode is and add-on for CellNOptR that allows for modeling using Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODEs)

# Dependencies

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# installs remotes package if not already installed 
# needed to retrieve and install packages from github
if(!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("remotes")

# installs CellNOptR and CNORode from GitHub
if(!requireNamespace("CellNOptR", quietly = TRUE)) remotes::install_github("saezlab/CellNOptR")
if(!requireNamespace("CNORode", quietly = TRUE)) remotes::install_github("saezlab/CNORode")
```

If you don't have the package `remotes` and cannot install it, then

1.  please visit the <https://github.com/saezlab/CellNOptR> and
    <https://github.com/saezlab/CNORode> websites,
2.  download the toolboxes by clicking "Clone or download" then "Download Zip"
3.  Unzip the files
4.  In R run:\
    `install.packages("../CellNOptR-master", repos = NULL, type = "source")`\
    `install.packages("../CNORode-master", repos = NULL, type = "source")`

Both
[`CellNOptR`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CellNOptR.html)
and
[`CNORode`](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/CNORode.html)
are also available via [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), a
repository for R packages for bioinformatics

To install the packages from Bioconductor you will need the package
`BiocManager`

`if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) install.packages("BiocManager")`

then run

`BiocManager::install("CellNOptR")` and `BiocManager::install("CNORode")`

Make sure to import the libraries

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(CellNOptR)
library(CNORode)
```

# PART I

The goals of part I are

-   get familiar with network file formats accepted as inputs to CellNOpt and
    other network modeling tools

-   check small network motifs to

    -   get use to the visualisation schemes
    -   understand the dynamic logic models

## Input Data

CellNOpt uses a prior knowledge network stated as an interaction file to build a
Boolean logic model.

**TASK 1**: check the format of the SIF file, in `data/tutorial_1_network.sif`:
You can open it in RStudio or running:

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("./data/tutorial_1_network.sif"))
```

SIF ([simple interaction
format](http://manual.cytoscape.org/en/stable/Supported_Network_File_Formats.html#sif-format))
is a file format that is simple to interpret and can be understood by other open
source platforms for network modeling and visualization such as
[Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).

We find 2 lines that describes 2 interactions between nodes a, b and c. Both
node a and node b can activate node c.

Large networks are complicated to check, therefore we can plot the network as a
graph.

**TASK 2** Visualise the SIF file in CellNOptR:

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
model <- readSIF("./data/tutorial_1_network.sif")
plotModel(model)
```

The graph shows the 2 interactions as expected.

The network is already converted to a network object:

```{r}
print(model)
```

-   *reacID* enumerates the edges of the network.
-   *nameSpecies*: contains the nodes
-   *interMat*: is an interaction matrix between nodes and edges
-   *notMat*: shows inhibitor edges (none in this model)

**TASK 3**: check the format of the MIDAS ([*Minimum Information for
DataAnalysis in Systems
Biology*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2617752/) ) file, in
`data/tutorial_1_data.csv` (best in Excel):

```{r}
writeLines(readLines("./data/tutorial_1_data.csv"))
```

Each row of the MIDAS file encodes a measurement. Column notations:

-   *TR*: treatment
-   *DA*: time of data acquisition
-   *DV*: measured value of the node

**TASK 4**: Create a CNOlist object from the MIDAS data file and annotate the
network

```{r fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
cnodata <- CNOlist("./data/tutorial_1_data.csv")
plotModel(model = model, CNOlist = cnodata)
```

Inputs (a and b) are highlighted with green, measured nodes are with blue.

**TASK 5**: Print and visualise the data object

```{r}
print(cnodata)
```

```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
plot(cnodata)
```

The figure shows an experiment in each line.\
Perturbations/Cues (a and b) are 1 (on) or 0 (off). Node C is activated only in
the last condition, where both A and B are activated.

## Model building

**TASK 6**: Simulate the model and compare it to the experimental data:

```{r,fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
edges <- c("a=c" = 1,
          "b=c" = 1)

sim_res <- cutAndPlot(cnodata, model, list(edges))
```

The model predicts an increase of node C if any of A or B increased, i.e. both A
and B can activate C.

Hint: The model assumes **OR** interaction

How do we fix it?

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
prep_model <- preprocessing(data = cnodata,
                           model = model,
                           cutNONC = TRUE,  # cut non-controllable subnetwork
                           compression = TRUE, # compress if possible
                           expansion = TRUE, # expand OR gates
                           verbose = TRUE)
plotModel(prep_model,cnodata)
```

The preprocessing steps included an **AND** gate between the inputs:

```{r}
print(prep_model$reacID)
```

Let's fix the model to match the measured data:

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
# we turn off the a=c and b=c edges: 
edges <- c("a=c" = 0,
          "b=c" = 0,
          "a+b=c" = 1)

sim_res_and <- cutAndPlot(cnodata, prep_model, list(edges))
```

The model with a single AND gate between the 2 edges is now in agreement with
the data.

Boolean algebra: What other Boolean operations are you familiar with? Which ones
do you think can be used to represent interactions in biological signaling
networks?

# PART II: Small, but realistic boolean model

The goals of PART II is to

-   check a small but more realistic model
-   optimise the model to data
-   do predictions to other condition --\> experimental design.

## Input data

**Task** : import the data and network file, visualise them separately.

```{r}
dataToy <- CNOlist("data/tutorial_2_data.csv")
networkToy <- readSIF("data/tutorial_2_network.sif")
```

The preprocessed experimental data:

```{r}
plot(dataToy)
```

This is a complex dataset, where the cells were treated with EGF and TNFa
stimuli in combination with RAF and PI3K inhibitors.

Can we answer questions, like: 1. what ligand activates AKT? 2. Is Hsp27
responding to EGF stimulation?

Now visualise the prior knowledge network: (it is very handy that we have one
and we dont have to read dozens of papers...)

This prior knowledge network contains all the edges among these nodes that we
think is relevant to the problem.

```{r}
plotModel(networkToy,CNOlist = dataToy)
```

There are red and white nodes:

-   red box indicates nodes that are inhibited in certain conditions,
-   white boxes are nodes that are not measured

Red T-shape arrows indicate inhibitory interactions.

Is this prior knowledge network in agreement with the above data?\
According to the prior knowledge, should Hsp27 respond to EGF?

## Simulate the model

Let's simulate the prior knowledge and compare it with the data:

```{r}
sim_PKN <- cutAndPlot(CNOlist = dataToy,
           model = networkToy,
           bStrings = list(rep(1,length(networkToy$reacID))))

```

Apparently the prior knowledge is not in agreement with the data. This happens,
because prior knowledge is not specific to the measured cell-line. It assessed
by us and we included many interactions that we belived is needed.

## Network model optimisation

To find a *subset* of edges that makes the model to fit the data we use
optimisation.

```{r}
prep_network_Toy <- preprocessing(dataToy, networkToy, 
                                  expansion=TRUE,
                                  compression=TRUE,
                                  cutNONC=TRUE,
                                  verbose=TRUE)

plotModel(prep_network_Toy ,dataToy)
```

Note the AND gates and missing white boxes. They disappeared beacause of
compression.

We use genetic algorithm to find an optimal set of edges.

```{r}
ToyT1opt <- gaBinaryT1(CNOlist=dataToy,
                       model=prep_network_Toy,
                       verbose=FALSE)
```

Plot the optimised network's prediction:

```{r}
sim_opt_PKN <- cutAndPlot(CNOlist = dataToy,
           model = prep_network_Toy,
           bStrings = list(ToyT1opt$bString))

```

show the optimised network:

```{r}
plotModel(prep_network_Toy,dataToy,bString = ToyT1opt$bString, removeEmptyAnds = F)
```

Here the edge color encodes if the edge is still included in the optimised
subnetwork. Black edge means that the edge is still active in the model, and
grey links are removed by the optimiser.

What did we optimize? How do we know how good a solution network is? How do we represent the problem? How does a genetic algorithm work? Can we use something else to solve the same problem?
